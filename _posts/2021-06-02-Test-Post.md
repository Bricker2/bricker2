## PowerShell repositories

If you follow my blog you probably know my [GitHub](https://github.com/PsCustomObject) where I share modules like the [IT-ToolBox](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox) or handy standalone [Functions](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/PowerShell-Functions) that I developed to solve specific issues.

In my posts I often talked about [PowerShell Gallery](https://pscustomobject.github.io/powershell/tips/PowerShell-Restore-Default-Repository/) which you probably already used to install a module released by Microsoft or other developers.

Both are great tools when sharing code with a large audience over the internet, GitHub Private repositories are scope of this article,  but a large chunk of my work involves developing *modules* that me and my colleagues user internally for automation purposes. These modules usually leverage technologies that are available only in my work environment and sometimes implement functions that would not have much sense outside my company.

One of the main issues we faced when initially started development of our own modules is ease of distribution to other team members for this reason we've setup internal **NuGet** repositories which can be used an *internal* PowerShell Gallery.

## Required tools

Here's what you will need to follow this article and setup your own PowerShell repository:

- A copy of **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)** the community edition will do just fine and it's free
- The ASP.NET and web development workload installed [here's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) a guide on how to modify an existing Visual Studio installation in case you don't have the appropriate workload installed already
- A server running a supported copy of **Windows Server** I am using Windows 2019 but 2016 will do just fine

## Create the Visual Studio Project

Once all requirements are in place open Visual Studio and  create a project using the *ASP.Web Application (Visual C#)* template.

Application name is not important just avoid *NuGet* as this would create a conflict with one of the *packages* we need to install as part of the dependencies, in my example I've used **NuGetRepository** but it can really be anything
