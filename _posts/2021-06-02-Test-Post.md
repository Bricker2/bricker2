## PowerShell repositories

If you follow my blog you probably know my [GitHub](https://github.com/PsCustomObject) where I share modules like the [IT-ToolBox](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/IT-ToolBox) or handy standalone [Functions](https://github.com/PsCustomObject/PowerShell-Functions) that I developed to solve specific issues.

In my posts I often talked about [PowerShell Gallery](https://pscustomobject.github.io/powershell/tips/PowerShell-Restore-Default-Repository/) which you probably already used to install a module released by Microsoft or other developers.

Both are great tools when sharing code with a large audience over the internet, GitHub Private repositories are scope of this article,  but a large chunk of my work involves developing *modules* that me and my colleagues user internally for automation purposes. These modules usually leverage technologies that are available only in my work environment and sometimes implement functions that would not have much sense outside my company.

One of the main issues we faced when initially started development of our own modules is ease of distribution to other team members for this reason we've setup internal **NuGet** repositories which can be used an *internal* PowerShell Gallery.
